> [!WARNING]
> The plugin has been released on March 27th, and since multiple bugs have been reported and feature requests have been made. I'm working on all of them and apologize for the inconvenience! Thank you for everyone contributing with this issue reports :D

# Installation

You can install this plugin as any other plugin on desktop via the plugin gallery. it is not supported on mobile.

The plugin is also available in beta through BRAT:
1. Install and enable the [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) in your vault.
2. Navigate to `Settings > BRAT > Beta Plugin List > Add Beta Plugin`.
3. Enter `https://github.com/ElsaTam/obsidian-extended-graph` into the input field and select `Add Plugin`.

# Disclosures

- **Network use**: only if you allow the loading of external images from the web (disabled by default).
- **Files outside of the vault**: only if you allow the loading of external images from your computer (disabled by default).

# Issues

Since the core graph plugin lacks an API and documentation, many features are experimental, and feedback is critical to identify and resolve bugs.

**Expected risks**:
- **Graph settings loss**: If the app does not close properly, graph settings could be lost. It *should* not happened, I haven't seen this bug in a long time, but I'm waiting for more testing before removing it from this list. If you want to be extra careful, make a copy of the file `.obsidian/graph.json` before enabling the plugin.

**Expected bugs**:
- **Files modification issues**: The plugin might not synchronize correctly with changes made in your vault even if the core plugin handles them properly (such as renaming, deleting or moving a file).
- **Asynchronous errors**: Rapid interactions (e.g., toggling features, switching views, modifying filters) can result in data inconsistencies due to asynchronous processing. Resetting the plugin usually resolves the issue. If not, close and reopen the tab.

Please, if you encounter any bug, even if it is in the list above, report [an issue](https://github.com/ElsaTam/obsidian-extended-graph/issues).
